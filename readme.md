# MovieBase
### Client-side React version

This is the client-side repository for the MoviBase application allowing users to view the details of the movies from the data base.

[The server-side part repository can be viewed here.](https://github.com/wojtek-lukowski/MovieBase)

Users need to create account and all the available movies will be displayed upon login. Then they can review particular titles, as well as their directors and genres. Users can also edit their profile data.

Except the React version, an alternative, independent Angular client-side part, using the same backend, has also been developed and can be ssen here: [GitHub](https://github.com/wojtek-lukowski/MovieBase-Angular), [url](https://wojtek-lukowski.github.io/MovieBase-Angular).

The project will be deployed soon.
